Global Superstore SQL Analysis
PostgreSQL Business Intelligence Project
Why I Built This
Data is useless until it answers business questions.
So I took the Global Superstore dataset and treated it like a real company dataset — not a classroom exercise.
The goal?
Turn raw transactional data into:
•	Clear performance metrics
•	Profitability insights
•	Customer intelligence
•	Strategic product decisions
All using PostgreSQL.

🛠 Tech Stack
•	PostgreSQL 17
•	pgAdmin
•	Advanced SQL
•	CTEs
•	Window Functions
•	Business KPI Analysis

🗄 Database Design
I designed the orders table to store:
•	Order details
•	Customer information
•	Product data
•	Sales & profit metrics
•	Shipping performance
•	Geographic data
Indexes were added on high-impact columns to simulate real-world performance optimization.
This isn’t just querying — it’s structured database thinking.

📊 What I Analyzed
Instead of random queries, I structured this like a business review.
1️⃣ Executive-Level KPIs
•	Total Revenue
•	Total Profit
•	Profit Margin %
•	Average Order Value
•	Customer & Product Counts
________________________________________
2️⃣ Category & Product Intelligence
•	Top & bottom performing products
•	Profit margin comparison
•	Sub-category deep dives
•	Product performance matrix using median thresholds
________________________________________
3️⃣ Customer Analytics
•	Top 20 revenue-generating customers
•	Retention segmentation
•	High-value order behavior
•	Customer lifetime indicators
________________________________________
4️⃣ Geographic Performance
•	Market-level profitability
•	Regional revenue comparison
•	Country-level insights
________________________________________
5️⃣ Operational Insights
•	Shipping efficiency analysis
•	Shipping cost vs profitability
•	Discount impact on margins
•	Year-over-year growth using window functions
________________________________________
🧠 Advanced SQL Concepts Used
•	GROUP BY + complex aggregations
•	CASE WHEN segmentation logic
•	CTEs (WITH clauses)
•	LAG() for growth analysis
•	PERCENTILE_CONT() for performance benchmarking
•	NULLIF() to prevent division errors
•	Type casting & numeric precision control
•	Index optimization
Everything was written to reflect how a real analyst works in production.

📈 Business Impact Simulation
This project answers questions like:
•	Which products should we scale?
•	Where are we leaking profit?
•	Are discounts helping or hurting?
•	Which customers drive the most value?
•	Is the business actually growing?
This is the kind of SQL I want to bring into a real analytics team.
